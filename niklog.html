                            Day 0 I’m so excited for this expedition I keep
                            knocking things over as I pack my bags. The team is
                            all ready to go tomorrow, and they head home to
                            spend one last night with their families. I think
                            I’ll sleep on the couch here tonight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 1 I asked Vera if she’d teach me tro drive the
                            RV, but she said no. Oh well. Maybe if I ask later
                            into the expedition, she’ll teach me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 3 Puja seems nice, but a bit off. She’s got some
                            kind of sadness to her I can’t quite pin down. She’s
                            the only one of us who can pull off the space suit,
                            though.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 7 I spent the day with King and helping with
                            some samples.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 9 I spent the day helping Armando with his
                            studies, trying to ignore our water situation.. He’s
                            a pius man, always praying, but I think if anything
                            his religion makes him more accepting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 10 I was lucky enough to find us water. Some
                            kind of old water source was still active, thank
                            heavens. This should keep us going for another 10
                            days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 12 I asked Lir for help setting up an experiment
                            of mine today. It wasn’t super necessary to ask him,
                            but I kinda want to get on better terms with him,
                            and hes not doing much these days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Day 15 The storm rolled in so quickly. Thankfully we
                            found shelter and can camp until the weather passes.
                            Maybe with this extra time I can get to know the
                            others better too.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Day 20 I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to get out
                            of there. There’s not a lot of space to go but the
                            cave looks deep, maybe just maybe I can find
                            anything to save us.
