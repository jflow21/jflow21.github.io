                            We left early and bright, our vehicle blessed by the
                            bloody dust on the wind and the prayer on my lips.
                            We were five. A leader, three scientists, and an
                            engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before leaving, we ensured the vehicle was ready,
                            prepared for our journey. But Olympus Mons watched
                            from a distance and decided to test us. Our water
                            filter malfunctioned, leaving us scrambling for
                            clean water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We searched the desert for water, hoping against all
                            odds. Our leader pushed us forward and kept us
                            strong. And then, when we thought it might be the
                            end, she fell and bled and water poured from her
                            feet.
                        </p>
                        <p>We were saved.</p>
                        <p>
                            Faith renewed, we continued on our journey. But
                            before long, another test was sent our way from the
                            watchful Olympus Mons. A fleet of devils met us at
                            the edge of the plains and drove us into the cliffs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our leader sheltered us in a cave for six days. We
                            were hidden from the shrieking devils, but soon our
                            water became short on supply. But once again, our
                            leader ventured out, cut herself on the cave walls,
                            and found water for us to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We began to equally fear and revere her. Her
                            self-sacrifice inspired us. But the desert made us
                            bitter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our last trial appeared further down the road. Our
                            vehicle stopped before we could ascend the plateau,
                            and we were stranded. Our food was dwindling. Our
                            communications were down. We had exhausted our hope
                            and had only our tenacity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her last miracle was finding the Mons Valley
                            mycelium. And her last gift was feeding it with her
                            flesh so that we may prosper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will forever appreciate her selflessness. Our
                            courageous volunteer who always put her people
                            first. We call the fungus Mother in her name. In her
                            honor.
