                        I say goodbye to my Shayla and boys today for the third
                        time. I reassure them that I'll be back before they know
                        it. My youngest is mad that I've been called to an
                        expedition again. And last time was supposed to be the
                        last time. I try to console him, but at the end of the
                        day, nothing I say will be enough for the poor lad.

                        Next, I met our geologist, A. He seems reserved but

                            V is hopping mad. Honest to god, I am too. There's
                            two days' worth of water before a recycling cycle
                            kicks in. If I can't get this fixed in the next few
                            days, we're going to have to start recycling in
                            other ways, but even that may not be enough to get
                            us all the way back. Might need to find ice instead.
                            Fuck.

                            So why in hell did the system not trigger a warning
                            days ago before jus crapping out. It seems one of
                            the pressure pumps is blown. It smells awful. After
                            further inspection of the system, that seems to be
                            the only problem. I rerouted the system to only use
                            the functional pump and ignore the failed one. It's
                            not perfect - filtration will be half as efficient -
                            but it'll do. It's just a band-aid to our problem, I
                            suspect an electrical surge somewhere upstream.

                        <p>Dear Shayla,</p>
                        <p>
                            I'm sorry for leaving you and the lads to manage on
                            your own again. I know how heavy the load falls on
                            you when I'm off chasing pumps in this blasted red
                            dust—Tommy's questions about “when's Da home?”
                            ringing through my head every damn day. I wish I
                            could be there to see Sean score that winning goal
                            or to help tuck them in at night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think of you all every time the rover shudders or
                            the comms console lights up—your faces are the only
                            thing that keeps me steady when I'm out here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I promise I'll haul my boots back across the void as
                            soon as this job's done.
                        </p>
                        <p>All my love,</p>

                            By God, we're saved. I though we were right fucking
                            goners. My boys will have their father again.
                            They'll grow happy and healthy. I'll get to hear my
                            dear wife's voice again.

                            I'll be honest, I thought I'd never make it back.
                            Thank the mother that we'll make it.
