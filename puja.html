                            Vera held a final briefing tonight, and I spent most
                            of it watching the condensation coil behind her
                            shoulder. The thing’s been dripping irregularly
                            lately—Lir says it's just surface tension
                            differences from the pressure cycling. Still, makes
                            me nervous. Reminds me how nothing here is really
                            built to last.

                            We’ve been given one of the old RV’s from the
                            extraction days. Lir’s been retrofitting the wheels
                            and patched up the solar shielding. Says it’ll make
                            the trip, “if God wills it.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inventory’s done. Food will run tight before we’re
                            halfway back—assuming we even make it that far.
                            Water’s better, for we’re praying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jerrica’s quiet tonight. She’s been scanning over
                            fungal genomes again. She always did think the
                            future could be bred into people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Armando blessed the RV this morning, pressed a rough
                            palm to its undercarriage and murmured something in
                            Spanish under his breath. I envy that.
                        </p>

                            King is asleep. He doesn’t know we’re leaving, but
                            he’s going. Jerrica insisted. Not sure if it’s
                            sentiment or specimen interest. The little guy’s
                            shedding. New scales look slightly iridescent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m bringing the field kit, two flasks of methanol,
                            a burner. It’s from Earth. I’ve been saving it.

                            They say Mars is silent. But I’ve learned: it hums.
                            Under the soil, inside the machines, in your own
                            head after a while.

                            Tomorrow we go west to find something that might
                            save the colony. I think I’m okay with it.

                            We left at 07:48 MTC. Forty-eight minutes late
                            because Lir’s power diagnostics glitched on boot,
                            and Vera insisted we run a full backup cycle. “Just
                            in case,” she said. Just in case what, I know—radio
                            works for now, and God knows there’s one on this
                            planet waiting to pick up our black box.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’ve started west, into the red flatlands. Not much
                            to look at—just ochre dust, shale fragments, and the
                            odd iron outcrop. Armando’s already taken five
                            samples. Or rather, Armando has already licked 5
                            random rocks. He gets this gleam in his eye when he
                            sees a ridge line like it’s flirting with him. I
                            said as much.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jerrica hasn’t said much. She’s got that distant
                            look again, scanning growth models like she’s going
                            to summon a miracle out of decimal points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nik asked to drive. Vera said Smart. The kid nearly
                            dropped our only medkit trying to “reorganize” the
                            supplies. Still, they’ve got that optimism. Kept
                            trying to name the RV something dumb, like Big Girl
                            or The Womb Truck. I laughed—I think.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We covered about 40 kilometers before nightfall.
                            We’ll pick up more distance once we’re past the
                            broken terrain. Vera’s keeping us on tight shifts.
                            I’m in the 2nd nav seat, mostly watching for rock
                            fall and radiation spikes. I’ve logged 17 already,
                            all within tolerable levels. For now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dinner was rehydrated starch blocks with salt tabs.
                            King ate better. Jerrica fed him a cricket frozen
                            from the colony’s gene bank. He chirped. Everyone
                            acted like that was cute. I don’t want to scream.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’ll sleep inside tonight, packed like cargo. I
                            brought earplugs. Still hear the hum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe I came out here hoping for something to fail
                            in a way I could finally stop pretending to fix. But
                            everyone keeps holding it together.

                        <p>The water filter broke.</p>
                        <p>
                            Technically, it’s the secondary pressure valve that
                            cracked—but the effect is the same: no filtration,
                            no clean water. Lir spent two hours trying to weld
                            it back together with a filament tip and whatever
                            scrap he could cannibalize from the rover’s spare
                            hull lining. It held for twenty-three minutes before
                            bursting with a noise like a bone snapping
                            underwater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We still have reserves. Vera says we’re fine for
                            now, but everyone’s doing the math in their heads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jerrica lost it a bit. Quietly. She didn’t yell or
                            anything — just... got that look, like someone was
                            peeling her open from the inside. She spent the
                            afternoon with King, misting his enclosure manually
                            with a syringe. Said it’s calming. I can’t tell if
                            she meant King or herself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nik offered to take shorter water rations. Said they
                            “don’t need that much anyway.” I think they mean it.
                            I think they believe that martyring themselves is a
                            kind of competence. That’s the part—how pure it all
                            still is with them. I know to admire them for it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Armando found a basalt ridge and wanted to sample
                            it. Vera said no. He didn’t argue, but I saw him
                            looking back at it through the window for a long
                            time. I think he prays when he thinks no one’s
                            watching. I caught him murmuring to his rock hammer
                            like it was a rosary.

                        <p>
                            We were parked near the edge of a canyon shelf when
                            they slipped. Went chasing a topographic anomaly on
                            the rover’s scanner—said it looked “wrong, but wrong
                            in a good way.” Vera told them to wait, but they
                            were already halfway down the slope before the words
                            finished forming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I thought they’d broken something. We all did. They
                            didn’t answer the first three hails. Jerrica looked
                            like she was about to throw up. Then the comm
                            crackled—static, then Nik’s voice, breathless, like
                            they were laughing and choking at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “There’s ice,” they said. “There’s f—frozen water,
                            tucked into a little wedge under a thermal shelf. I
                            think we can melt it.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relief in the RV was… grotesque. Like someone
                            had just reset the death clock. Lir jumped into
                            action immediately, started prepping a siphon and
                            filtration line. Armando said “blessed be,”
                            unironically. Vera smiled. A real smile, for the
                            first time in days. I just sat there. Watching her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was like we were all in a play and I’d forgotten
                            my lines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nik got back covered in red dust, bleeding from a
                            scratch down their left arm, and beaming. They
                            looked like a kid who’d found treasure. Vera hugged
                            them. I thought for a second Jerrica might cry. She
                            didn’t. Instead she gave them her protein ration.
                            Again. That’s twice now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How quickly everyone snapped back into belief—this
                            solved something. We found water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nik is still smiling in the corner. I want to ask
                            them why.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want to ask what they think is waiting at the end
                            of this road.

                        It came from the south, fast. Faster than it should
                        have. Lir saw the drop in barometric pressure before
                        anyone else—shouted for us to seal the vents, stow what
                        we could, and brace. Armando yelled something about dust
                        devils, but this wasn’t a devil. It was a god. A
                        furious, shapeless god of grit and static and wind. The
                        sky turned orange-black. Visibility dropped to meters.
                        The RV started to scream—not the engine, the body. The
                        metal itself flexing under pressure, joints groaning
                        like something alive was trying to crawl out from
                        inside. We bailed. No choice. Nik spotted a rock face up
                        ahead, maybe fifty meters east—called out a shadow that
                        turned out to be a cave. A real one. Not a scan blip,
                        not a rover pit stop—an actual pocket in the Martian
                        crust, carved by pressure and time. We made a call. No
                        choice, really. If the RV rolled, we were dead. We had
                        to get it under cover. So we dragged it. Harnesses,
                        tethers, shoulders to metal. Jerrican and Armando pushed
                        from the rear while Vera and Lir guided the front. I ran
                        alongside, calling slope angles and surface types. Nik
                        lit the path with a flare. Every meter was war. The wind
                        ripped at our suits. Static popped in our ears. The
                        ground kept sliding out beneath us. At one point we
                        almost lost Jerrica in a side-drift, but Very pulled her
                        back by the wrist just in time. It took us 27 minutes. I
                        counted. And then — somehow — we got the RV into the
                        cave. Inside, it’s cold. Bitter. And quiet in a way that
                        doesn't feel safe. The storm outside sounds like a war
                        between planets. Nik managed to calibrate the long-range
                        transmitter and sent an SOS ping. Repeated bursts,
                        tagged to Colony East. Vera dictated it: "Storm event,
                        loss of visibility, possible shelter coordinates.
                        Request confirmation.” We waited. For hours. Then the
                        tower blew. It was subtle—a snap, a smoke curl, a final
                        death whine from the circuit boards. Nik punched the
                        cave wall. Didn’t say anything after that. We are, as of
                        now, alone. Jerrica hasn’t spoken since. She’s just
                        sitting with King, wiping dust from his tank every
                        fifteen minutes like it’s the one thing she can control.
                        Lir keeps checking the fried tower, muttering
                        possibilities. Vera’s trying to keep us on a rotation
                        schedule, assigning watches and water duties like she
                        still believes someone is coming. I wish I believed
                        someone was. We don’t know if the colony got the ping.
                        We don’t know if they think we’re dead.

                        Today broke something. Not the radio—though that’s still
                        dead. Not the cave walls—though the wind hasn’t stopped
                        screaming. Something else cracked. Maybe us. It started
                        with the water again. It always circles back to water.
                        Lir was trying to re-rig the filtration line Nik pulled
                        from the rover, but it’s not designed for this. We’ve
                        been boiling meltwater in the fuel basin, scraping
                        mineral dust from the edges, trying not to breathe too
                        deep. Nik laughed. That made it worse. “I found the
                        water,” they said, like that settled it. And maybe it
                        should’ve. But Lir shot back, something sharp and
                        technical about inefficiencies and contamination and how
                        finding something doesn’t mean much if it can’t be used.
                        Vera tried to mediate, but even she couldn’t keep the
                        tone out of her voice. Nik went quiet, eyes glassy, body
                        eerily still. After an eternity, they made eye contact
                        with each of us and ran down further into the cave. I
                        didn’t defend them. I didn’t defend anyone. I just sat
                        against the wall, listening to everyone say things we
                        won’t come back from. Lir threw a wrench at the cave
                        wall. Didn’t say anything else for hours. No one made a
                        plan today. We didn’t even count rations. We just yelled
                        until we were tired, then sat in the quiet with our own
                        thoughts, which might be louder. Me? I’m too tired to be
                        afraid. I think part of me always knew it would end like
                        this—dust in the lungs, silence on the radio, and too
                        many people in too small a cave. I keep imagining what
                        it would sound like if the cave collapsed. Probably
                        quieter than today.

                        Nik is hurt. But of course, Nik also found more water.
                        Bleed. Save us. Repeat. They went deeper into the cave
                        system early this morning, before rotation started.
                        Didn’t tell anyone. Vera woke up and realized they were
                        gone—went full command-mode, already halfway into her
                        suit before the rest of us were even conscious. I didn’t
                        rush. Not because I didn’t care, but because… I don’t
                        know. You can only sprint toward someone so many times
                        before it starts to feel like theater. It took three
                        hours to find them. Lir and Armando tracked their boot
                        pattern through a side tunnel until the prints blurred
                        into dust. The air thinned. Jerrica wanted to turn back.
                        Vera didn’t. I followed. We found Nik at the bottom of a
                        basalt chute, wedged between a jagged outcrop and the
                        ice wall they’d apparently been trying to sample. Right
                        leg twisted, bleeding down one side. Their mask was
                        cracked, but sealed enough. And they were smiling again.
                        “I found it,” they said, through a broken tooth.
                        “There’s a whole sheet of ice behind the wall. Thick,
                        too. Cold like Earth winters.” Then they passed out.
                        Vera carried them back herself. Didn’t let Lir help. I
                        think she needed to do it—for control, or guilt, or
                        both. Nik is sleeping now, with King perched on their
                        chest like a paperweight. Jerrica hasn’t said a word to
                        them. She also hasn’t left the med kit’s side since we
                        returned. Lir tried to fix the secondary transmitter
                        again tonight. No luck. The main radio’s still fried. No
                        ping from the colony. So that’s it. Nik’s leg is
                        probably fractured. We’re deeper in the cave than
                        planned. We’re almost out of antibiotics. And we found
                        ice. Enough to buy us weeks. Maybe longer if we ration.
                        But no one smiled about it this time. Even Vera just
                        nodded. We all know what it means now. We’re not going
                        back. Not really. We’re only going forward. It’s cold
                        tonight. Colder than I’ve felt since we left base. I
                        don’t think it’s the air.

                        The silence woke me. Not the shriek of wind against
                        rock, not sand hissing through crevices in the cave
                        wall, not Lir swearing under his breath while
                        recalibrating sensors in the dark. Just silence. It took
                        me a full minute to register it was real. Another to
                        believe it wasn’t worse. Then Vera unsealed the thermal
                        panel covering the entrance. Light poured in—thin,
                        watery, Martian—but after six days underground, it felt
                        like a flood. We stepped outside like ghosts. Everyone
                        blinking, squinting, silent. The horizon was clean. No
                        walls of rust, no smoke-thick sky. Just the stillness
                        that comes after fury. Nik hobbled out last, leaning on
                        Armando like it was nothing. They looked… smaller. But
                        also impossible to ignore. The way everyone looked at
                        them today felt different. Like they knew. Like we all
                        knew. We spent most of the morning salvaging what we
                        could from the RV. The satellite relay is gone. Blasted
                        or buried. Either way, it’s over. The colony thinks
                        we’re dead. Maybe they need to believe that. Jerrica’s
                        stopped asking if we’ll get another message. Lir doesn’t
                        talk about the comms anymore. Vera stares off when no
                        one’s speaking. She’s doing the math. We packed up and
                        left the cave around mid-afternoon. The dust makes it
                        hard to gauge time, but it felt right. The land ahead is
                        smoother now, less elevation, easier for Nik to manage.
                        Armando plotted a course northeast, following the slope
                        of the last ridge. Eastward. Always eastward. The storm
                        ended. But it didn’t bring relief. Just clarity. We are
                        well and truly alone.

                        We started rationing today. Officially. There were
                        mutterings before—Lir running silent calorie counts on
                        his pad, Jerrica turning over nutrient packs in her
                        hands like she could multiply them through will
                        alone—but today, Vera made the call. One pack per person
                        per day. Half if we can stretch it. It’s not enough. Not
                        for this terrain, not for the cold. But it’s all we
                        have. Nik hasn’t complained. They never do. They’ve been
                        walking better—still limping, but moving without help. I
                        caught them whispering to King last night, something
                        about Earth lizards and heat lamps. The way they talk to
                        that creature… it’s gentle. I don’t see that in the
                        others anymore. Maybe never did. Armando said grace at
                        dinner. Well, whatever counts as dinner now: one squeeze
                        of grainpaste and a handful of filtered melt. I don’t
                        believe in God—never did—but for a second, I was jealous
                        of him. Not of the faith, exactly. Of the shape of it.
                        Something to speak into the silence. Lir made another
                        attempt at a directional ping this morning. Still
                        nothing. “Maybe the colony did try to send something,”
                        he said, like that should comfort us. Maybe they did.
                        Maybe they didn’t. Maybe it doesn’t matter anymore.
                        Everyone’s thinner. Jerrica’s cheeks are drawn. Vera’s
                        fingernails are cracked. Armando hasn’t laughed in four
                        days.

                        I know I said I was done with this damned diary, but I
                        lied. We have found our savior. It’s a fungus — Mons
                        Valley Fungus is our name for it. Thrives on biomass.
                        I’m no energy scientist, but I’ve been told that we
                        could solve our colony’s energy problem if we could
                        capture even a small amount of the energy it gives off.
                        One problem — we’re still stuck here with no means of
                        transportation and no way to get help from the colony.
                        We’re also almost out of power, and once we’re out,
                        we’re dead. Lir and Jerrica think that we could harvest
                        some of the energy from the fungus, and they’re working
                        together on some sort of apparatus for it. But to
                        recharge our batteries, we would need a significant
                        amount of biomass, more than we have just laying around.

                        The fungus—God, we still don’t even know what to call
                        it—it pulses when we get close. Not like it’s hostile.
                        More like it’s waiting. It’s not just eating—it’s
                        responding. The structure’s denser now, almost vascular.
                        The light it gives off is warmer, more rhythmic. Alive.
                        Vera’s the only one still talking like we have choices.
                        She keeps saying we’ll find another way. That we’re
                        scientists. That sacrifice is for myths and martyrs. But
                        even her voice is smaller now. Even she won’t meet Nik’s
                        eyes. It’s not just survival. It’s math. It’s biology.
                        It’s reality. Nik knows that it’ll be them. I think they
                        do. I told myself I didn’t care if this colony died.
                        That I didn’t care if we all failed. But now that it’s
                        in front of me—salvation in a bloom, and the cost
                        standing next to it—I realize I do care.

                        We all knew what was coming. Vera tried to delay it,
                        give speeches about ethics and civilization and the
                        meaning of consent. But that kind of language feels
                        brittle now. We’re past speeches. It took three days of
                        silence shaped like talking. Then this morning she
                        didn’t stop it. They blinked a few times, then they
                        walked away. I think that hurt Jerrica, though she
                        wouldn’t admit it. Vera hasn’t spoken since. She sat
                        outside the camp all night, helmet off, just staring
                        into the fungus-lit dark. Nik sacrificed themselves
                        willingly. That they walked into the bloom for all of
                        us. That they were brave. Nik sacrificed themself.
