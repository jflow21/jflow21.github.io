                        This week, my family received less than last month. The
                        Overseer's guidance says we must trust the greater plan,
                        but I wonder how we are chosen.

                        The lack is the test. We are measured not in fullness
                        but in faith. Drink less. Speak less. Obey more.

                        The rations flow through divine arithmetic. All who
                        question must purify. I suggest a fast and reflection

                        There are patterns in the allocations. The ones nearest
                        the Temple always receive more. Faith may explain it...
