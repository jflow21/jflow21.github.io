                            The Mons Mycelia consumes and processes materials
                            into biomass faster than anything I've ever seen! It
                            appears to gather most of its energy by breaking
                            down various wavelengths of radiation, making the
                            areas around if safer for human habitation. It also
                            spreads like kudzu across the lost cities of Earth.
                            I imagine it could be used to help create a safe
                            colony space for the long term.

                        <p>
                            Additionally, It shows a remarkable level of genetic
                            flexibility. It appears to be able to copy and
                            utilize genetic information from other lifeforms.
                            This was discovered when some of the samples I had
                            been feeding King appeared to metastasize into a
                            growth in the tank. King appeared to be unaffected
                            at worst, and thriving at best. The key detail is
                            that the mushroom had a growth covered in scales
                            identical to those on King.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I just hope the thing doesn't take to spraying blood
                            like its genetic benefactor.

                            idea. None of us will make it home as is. But we can
                            await rescue.

                            The only way we make it that long though is with the
                            mushroom. It would need a substantial chunk of
                            biomass, but providing this could allow me to direct
                            the growth to or near our RV to help maintain a
                            habitable environment. I am testing this with King's
                            habitat soon.

                            DNA is fascinating. It changes everything.

                            A decision had to be made. With King's new habitat
                            proving the viability of my idea, we knew we had to
                            feed it. Everyone but Nik agreed. The question came
                            down to who.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nik volunteered. She had no family, no career, not
                            future here. She saw that her sacrifice would save
                            so many and chose to do so. Lir and I helped
                            facilitate the transition. We shall see if this is
                            enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rest in Peace, Nik.</p>

                            The Mons Mycelia is much easier to shape than I had
                            expected. It is as if I can talk to it. Our
                            temporary habitat is set up, with one less occupant
                            than expected. Vera lost herself to the guilt of not
                            being able to save everyone and wandered into the
                            wastes. I expect they won't make it past tomorrow.

                            Nik is dead so we can live. We should honor her, not
                            sully her memory with tragedy.

                            I can feel the Mons Mycelia at the fringes of my
                            thoughts. It was listening? It doesn't “talk” but
                            does provide subtle signals. I don't know how to
                            explain it other than a hand guiding my path but not
                            determining it. If controlled, this effect could
                            massively shape the efficiency of our colony.

                            We have the opportunity to truly become something
                            greater together. Cells to a larger body. A
                            comforting thought.

                            We're back. The others almost didn't believe us
                            about the Mons Mycelia. They believed our recounts
                            of how the others fell though, with much sadness
                            expressed at the martyrdom of Nik and Vera.

                            discussing mobilizing the colony to try and rebuild
                            around the mushroom. I will join them. We shall
                            carve out a new future together, united under her
                            lordship, the Mother.
